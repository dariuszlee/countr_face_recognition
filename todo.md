# Week January 27 2020

## Critical
1. Path fixing [Y]
2. Deploy on RaspberryPi
3. Error Handling - Better reporting to client

## Good To Have
1. Add debugability to database - (ie. store image with embedding)
2. Test different camera sources (ie. get lowest possible deployable quality)
3. Send smallest image format... then convert to three channels if necessary

## Dev-Ops
1. Ensure Opencv version configurability

## Automated Testing
1. Unit Tests...
2. Build Tests. Automated docker for example on various platforms
3. Communication tests (Server - Client)
4. Client Interactions

## Client Feedback
1. Logging framework

## Mtcnn-Java
1. Deploy fork somewhere

## Client-Side FaceRecognition
1. Test with the quick opencv face detect

## Neural Network
1. Experiment with 'less' deep networks
